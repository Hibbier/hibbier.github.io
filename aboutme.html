    experince working on a freelance projects. First I had an interest in graphic design and have experience working for

  <h1 class="hobbies">Hobbies </h1>
  <p>In my spare time I like to keep active by working out and try and keep on top of my fitness. I also like to play
    basketball when the weather is nicer outside too. When I want some down time I'd usually play online games with
    friends or wind down and watch certain series when I'm in he mood for just watching something. </p>
