         <h2 class ="richbackground">Background </h2>
         <h3 class="richbackinfo">When I was working in retail I managed to do some networking with customers and came across a photography business owner. They had already an existing website but it was one he had created himself. </h3> 
         <h2 class="richproblem">Problem Statement</h1>
         <h3 class ="richstate">My client already had a website that he created but wanted an online precence that represented his brand more professionally </h3>
         <h1 class="richwire">Wireframe Idea Generation </h1>
         <img class="richwireimg" src="/Images /richwireframe1.png" alt="richwirepic" align="left">
         <img class="richwireimg2" src="/Images /richwireframe2.png" alt="richwirepic2" align="left"> 
         <h3 class="richwireinfo">When it came to designing the low fedelity designs for the wireframes I decided to inspect the existing website which my client had designed for himself. I could think of a few ways of how certain changes could attract the users attention more with some elements being added. </h3> 
         <h3 class="richwireinfo2">One of the layout ideas was having more visuals to give more of a impact on the users first impressions on my clients work. having some of the photography from the weddings my client had worked on would showcase his skill level and what he could provide for them too.</h3>
         <h1 class="richcolourh1">Colour Inspiration</h1>
         <img class="richcolourimg" src="Images /richcolour1.png" alt="richcolourpic"> 
         <h3 class="richcolourinfo">There was an original colour scheme with my clients original logo but the logo got changed during this project. He wanted to have some form of green as the primary colour to represent his brand. Olive green was the type that was desired but it ended up being a green which is similar to what he had in mind. </h3>
         <h3 class="richcolourinfo2">The other colours used were more monochrome and bland to make the primary green colour stand out. These two colours seemed to work well with the primary colour... in terms of text and readability if the colours overalpped one another </h3>
