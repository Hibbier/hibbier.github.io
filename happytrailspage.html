    <h1 class="happystatement">Problem Statement</h1>
    <p>My client came to me with a website that she had designed herself which she uses for her dog walking business. She ideally wants a website that represents her business to a more professional standard. She already has a Logo and colour scheme but she wants a more personal feel with visuals for example. I wanted to create a solution that would attract more clients and give her business a more approachable image.</p>

    <h3 class="wireframeinfo">An example of a wireframe idea for the homepage design. I wanted to add more visuals to <br> the current homepage design. An example would be including a hero section underneath <br> the navigation. having some form of pattern or illustration which would draw the users <br>attention with something relatively important or to give a positive first impression to the <br> user seemed like a priority in the visuals.Â </h3>
